# NeoSublimeBot – Automation Learning Experiment

This repository contains a small experimental project created to explore basic automation concepts using n8n and a Telegram bot.

The project was used as a learning exercise to understand how automation workflows can be connected to messaging platforms and deployed using container-based tools.

---

## Project purpose

The main purpose of this project was to:

- Explore automation workflows using n8n  
- Test basic integration with a Telegram bot  
- Understand deployment and platform limitations  
- Learn through experimentation rather than production use  

The project was intentionally simple and created for educational purposes.

---

## Project context

During experimentation, the automation workflows were tested and functioning within the n8n environment.

However, continued usage was affected by changes and limitations in free-tier access, and the project was not further developed beyond the initial learning phase.

---

## Project status

This project is not actively maintained and is not intended for production use.

It remains in this repository as a learning artifact that reflects experimentation with automation tools and platform constraints.

---

## Notes

This repository represents a short learning experiment rather than a finished or fully deployed application.
